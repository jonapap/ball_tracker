# BallTracker

Simple program made using OpenCV that will track a red ball. It also calculates the speed of the ball and will use this calculated information to extrapolate the ball's position if it loses track of it.

By default, the video output is only displayed on the screen. To write the output to a file, pass `-write` as an argument and a file named `output.avi` will be created in the program's directory.
